# onedarkpro-rust README

## Introduction

This theme has been modified based on [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) to make it more compatible with Rust.

I just use vscode command: `>Developer: Generate Color Theme From Current Settings` to make a json copy and modify this file.

## Effect
The brackets are not rendered correctly in CodeSnap and other is correct. You can download the theme plugin to exprirence it by youself.
